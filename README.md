# Smartguide Holzkirchen

We are a group of students of the Staatliches Gymnasium Holzkirchen and have been working on this project for a couple of months. Over the course of this time we have gotten to know our hometown and its beautiful sights a lot better. To share our knowledge, we created an app filled with audioguides and informative texts. Additionally, authentic images help to create a real-life impression. We hope you enjoy it. All Content is available with the option to choose between German and English version's.

## Availability

The Content is available as a Website as well as an App.

### App for iOS and Android

You can download the App via the App- and PlayStore (not yet, we are working on getting the App on both Stores).
At the moment there is a pre-release available on GitHub, while all content is available there might be typo's and bugs to be found.
\
The App was programmed with Google's framework [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) by [Leonhard von Foerster](https://github.com/Leo-vF), you can see the Code in [this repository](https://github.com/Leo-vF/smartguide).

### Website

All the content is also available as a [Website](smartguide-holzkirchen.web.app), so you can access it through a browser if you do not need/want an App to be installed.
\
The Website was with Facebook's framework [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react) programmed by [Tobias Bauer](https://github.com/Tobias-Bauer) you can see in [this repository](https://github.com/Tobias-Bauer/Smartguide-Holzkirchen).
